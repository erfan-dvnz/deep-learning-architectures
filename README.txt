This project attempts to evaluate and analyse the performance and results of three deep learning architectures:

	1. GoogLeNet
	2. VGG-16
	3. ResNet-34

For the dataset, the MNIST dataset is used.
The report details the evaluation and analysis of said architectures.
You may find the code (plus sample output plots) in the Code + Plots folder.
